Sum and Difference
Write a program to get 2 numbers from the user and calculate their sum and difference using '+' and '-' operators respectively. Print the corresponding sum and difference of the numbers as output in the console.
Input format:

First input: an integer

Second input: an integer



Output format:

First output will be the sum of two integers

Second output will be the difference of two integers



Sample Input:

55

34



Sample Output:

89

21

Case 1
Input (stdin)
-98
-5

Output (stdout)
-103
-93

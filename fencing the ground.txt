Fencing The Ground
The college ground is rectangular in shape. Management decides to build a fence around the ground. In order to help the construction workers to build a straight fence, they planned to place a thick rope around the ground. They wanted to buy only the exact length of the rope that is needed. They also wanted to cover the entire ground with a thick carpet during the rainy season. They wanted to buy only the exact quantity of carpet that is needed. They requested your help. Can you please help them by writing a program to find the exact length of the rope and the exact quantity of carper that is required?
Input Format:

Input consists of 2 integers.

The first integer corresponds to the length of the ground

The second integer corresponds to the breadth of the ground.



Output Format:

Output consists of 2 integers.

The first integer corresponds to the exact length of the rope

The second integer corresponds to the exact quantity of carper.



Sample Input:

20



Sample Output:

140m

1000sqm

Case 1
Input (stdin)

#solution in python

rope_length = (length + breadth) * 2
carpet = length * breadth
